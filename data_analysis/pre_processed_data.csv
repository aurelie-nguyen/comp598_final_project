55	d	unnecessary covid 19 deaths rival civli war deaths  effective medications exist    
57	d	 if biden was president when covid started how many people would not have died   how many people that voted for trump know someone that got covid that could have stayed healthy if trump had been a safer leader instead of minimizing covid's danger 
59	t	as i said before  this is a dangerous game  vaccinated people are getting covid  it seems at this point everyone with symptoms should tested     
61	h	everything i needed to know about local covid rates  but didn't need to ask because we're right off the main thoroughfare to the hospital and can hear the sirens 
63	m	 100% predictable back to march 2020  zero blm riots if our government didn’t throw 50 million people out of a job  there was never a covid crisis  only a government created crisis  average age of covid death is 80  80% of deaths obese  80% preexisting conditions  that’s who dies
